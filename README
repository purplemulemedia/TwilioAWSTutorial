Code for tutorial on creating a simple txt bot using Twilio and AWS. 



Pre req

1. Twilio Account
2. AWS Account
3. Nodejs
4. NPM or Yarn

Overview:
End User (Jane) sends a txt message to your Twilio #.  
Twilio runs a web hook and sends a post to an AWS API Gateway endpoint.
The API Gateway sends the post data to "RecieveFromTwilio" lambda function.
"RecieveFromTwilio takes the data and puts it on an SNS Topic "FromTwilio"
"ProcessTxtMessage" is listening to the "FromTwilio" Topic and processes the message
"ProcessTxtMessage" builds a response txt message and sends to the SNS Topic "ToTwilio"
"SendToTwilio" Lambda function listens to the "ToTwilio" topic and sends message to Twilio via the Twilio API
Twilio sends the response to the End User (Jane) 

Setup:

On Twilio:
1. From the Twilio dashboard note your SID and Secret Token you will need them to connect AWS to Twilio
2. Get a new phone number from Twilio make sure it supports SMS.

On AWS:
